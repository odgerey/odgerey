### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Current MA of Information student at U of T studying ethics, methodology, and frameworks in humanities and social sciences. 

Am currently researching on biopolitics & social media. I am interested in using new epistomlogical approaches and have a disdain for traditional essays.

Questions I have => What should be in the modern academic toolkit and how can we do research better? Netnography is exciting, but maybe we need to learn how to do it ethically? 

I'm a trained full-stack developer and am in the process of learning data sciences.
