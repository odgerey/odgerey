### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
Working on building a tight portfolio. 
Currently working on a restaurant site created with a turbo 360 tutorial: https://resto-ugsdbb.turbo360-vertex.com/


<!--
**odgerey/odgerey** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a DJing platform, a wordpress site, a squarespace site, two shopifys and one react site. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning history and sustainability at the University of Concordia, as well as through MOOC edX. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on hackathons. 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with BUGS.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my 1001 projects.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: @odgerey on every platform.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was a flight attendant.
